Project Overview:
	The website is a social network website designed for users to organize social meet-up events with strangers or friends. Users can host or join events in various categories. Users will be able to browse lists of incoming events, create events according to his/her own taste and view other people's profiles pages. Once users find out about an event that they want to join, they can send an application with comments to the organizer. The organizer will be able to selectively accept these event application after reviewing the applicants' profiles. 

Package Contents:
	The zip file package contains 8 html files, and three folders. They are:
		
		home_page.html
		categories_page.html
		event_page.html
		my_events_management_page.html
		my_profile_page.html
		profile_page.html
		search_result_page.html
		signup_page.html

		images/
		scripts/
		stylesheets/

	Graphic resources are stored in the "images" folder. Javascript files are stored in the "scripts" folder. CSS files are in the "stylesheets" folder.

Key Features:
	In the home page, events from various categories are displayed with a title and a event theme picture. When users click on the photo, the photo will flip over and show additional info: organizer info, event description and two buttons: "more info" and "I want in". The "more info" button will take the user to the specific page for the even (Since we do not have the back end PHP, it is not efficient to create dozens of event page htmls, therefore we link all event links to one single event. The same happends for profile pages and category page). Once the user click on "I want in", a pop-up window will prompt users to put in a comment to send to the organizer. 

	In the my_events_management_page.html, users will be able to access the events they created and be able to modify the contents of the event: location, time, description and event picture. In addition, event organizers will be able to see who are already allowed to join the event, and all pending applicaitons. Organizers can kick people out of the event after they have been admitted, approve applications so they appear in the "already in" section and reject applications. These are all done with animation. These actions will link with the backend once database gets involved.
